		This is the part where we look at ways, methods, of discovering/finding past lives. We will look at any scientific route and any spiritual route.
		We <strong><u>DO NOT</u></strong> guarantee that any of this will work, so it is best practice to not get your hopes up. However, we can at least <u>look</u> at what ways there are or could be. We will also look into why we forget our past lives, theoretically at least.
		If we can find if we forget then we can find out how and why we forget, then maybe we can find/discover reincarnation. As always, do your own independent research and decide for yourself.

		<h2>Do We Forget Our Past Lives?</h2>
		<p>
		Do we not know, or know very little, about past lives because we forget them?
		If it is a case of we do forget, then lets start with WHY we forget!
		</p>
	</div>
</div>



<div class="why-do-we-forget-area">
	<div class="why-do-we-forget">
		<h2>Why Do We Forget?</h2>
		<p>According to our research, we forget for a number of possible reasons. Those possible reasons are possible/potential pain or negative experiences, shame, shock, horror, regret, remorse, fear, boredom or grief. Basically, the potential for negative memory to re-occur or to bubble up to the surface. Some say it is our tendency to forget. Others say that scientists have found that the chemical oxytocin is associated with both amnesia and pregnancy. So, the biological cause of our past-life amnesia could be the oxytocin secretion in our mother's womb when we were there. Another possible reason is our innate psychological defence mechanism to forget painful events/incidents. Another reason is society's prejudice against reincarnation by religious indocrination causing wilful forgetfulness in order to fit in. Others say that we agreed to forget our past lives deliberately and for good reason, we do not remember our past lives in order to free ourselves to make different choices, we can literally start over again. Another possible reason is that the universe wants to make sure that you've learnt your lesson/s. An interesting explanation discovered says or states that wearing the "veil of unknowingness" makes it easier for us to live our life now.

		<h2>Can We Prove Reincarnation To Be True/Fact?</h2>
		<p>
		So far, no. No-one can prove reincarnation to be fact or true. There is currently no direct proof. Infact, our research suggests or points out that discovery of or direct proof of reincarnation could, not will, be made via spiritual means. We have learnt, so far, that we can only get so far with science when it comes to finding factual information regarding reincarnation, however, we still have much to discover scientifically. In our research, we have discovered that reincarnation fits nicely in the context of the spiritual or being spiritual, which would make sense since reincarnation is a direct element of life and death. When it comes to scientific understanding of reincarnation, it has begun but it's at very early stages. Perform your own independent research into Dr Ian Stevenson's research into birthmarks.

<div class="are-there-signs-area">
	<div class="are-there-signs">
		<h2>Are there signs? Is there evidence?</h2>
		<p>
		Well, after quite a bit of research, we have discovered that there are several scientific indications that might, not will, make for a strong argument for the theory of reincarnation.
		There are many reincarnation cases that might merit your attention. There are lots of independent researchers who are able to give strong arguments for reincarnation but also there are some who could offer arguments against the theory. 

		As always, do your own <u>independent</u> research and then make up your own mind about reincarnation. Be sure to weigh the pros against the cons, write down facts and then the fictitious. Whether or not they are reliable is up to you to decide for yourself.

		<br>Independent research continues for information in identifying signs that we have lived before. There are some links down below for your parousel.
		Go through all of the links and, should you want to, make notes.

		If the links below do not provide the evidence then how do we prove something we can't see or physically touch?
		Is it a question of lifting the veil, so-to-speak, how do we do that?

	   	Hypnosis/Self-Hypnosis. You can try "self-hypnosis", WikiHow shows you how in the link below. 
	    Whether this works or not is to be seen but many do say that hypnosis helps. It is an individual focused practice but it is <u>not</u> guaranteed to work. Hypnosis can be a powerful tool so it is quite advisable, if not strongly advisable, to find a professional hypnotist.
	    However, some say that hypnosis isn't entirely "accurate" all the time.

		<h2>Regression Therapy</h2>
		<p>In our research, we have come across lots of different forms of information regarding reincarnation. We've discovered lots of facts and, along the way, we have discovered related bits of information. We have learnt about something called regression therapy. What is regression therapy? Regression therapy is when one person is hypnotised or put into a state of hypnosis in order to find the source that has caused or causes current problems for the individual which might be found in their past life/lives. For a more detailed explanation please go to the links below to learn more about it. We have learnt that there are varying thoughts/opinions of regression therapy, some have positive views and thoughts whilst others have negative views and thoughts. It is, therefore, up to you to decide.</p>

		<h2>Science</h2>

		<p>The next method uses science but, unfortunately, it is very much incomplete but it is also at very very early stages. How do we access the non-physical through science? At what level do we start studying? Well, we have to start with the basics beginning with the brain. We then do what we can to understand the mind and conciousness. Have a look at the Quantum physics link, do your own independent research and come to your own conclusion

		<br>There is one person who began to study the non-physical or the non-physical phenomena but didn't finish. This person was said, by some, to be ahead of his time. His work made

		<h2>
			A perspective on Nikola Tesla & his inventions. By BRIGHT INSIGHT
		</h2>

		<p>
		Tesla hasn't proven reincarnation to be fact/true but he may have provided the next possible route, so far, that might help us. 
		If we use science to lift the so-called veil then what will we find?
		What will happen if we try to go down the route of energy, frequency and vibration?
		<!--If we use science to define spirit and the universe, will that help?-->
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Tesla and his inventions should've changed the world for the better but sadly they didn't. 
		His inventions should've developed mankinds understanding of nature and life.
		Nikola studied the fundamentals of life in terms of electricity, vibration, energy plus frequency.
		</p>
		

		<p>
		He looked deeply into why nature behaved the way it did do.
		He discovered advanced ways of lighting and applied modern uses of electricity, advanced at the time. 
		</p>
		

		<p>
		What happened to his tech goes something like this, certain types of people stopped his
		technology from benefitting humanity because it prevented business types from making a profit.
		Some say they, the business types, saw what he created and kept his information secret from the public, who knows?
		</p>
		

		<p>
		Please check the video above and below for some interesting, thought provoking, information about Nikola Tesla and his inventions.

		To find out about reincarnation, firstly, we need to know about some of life's mysteries, the mind and intuition. If we can truly understand the mind and intuition, will we discover anything about reincarnation? <u>BRIGHT INSIGHT</u> gives his thoughts.

		<h1>Tesla, Pyramids and Nature</h1>
		<p>
			Nikola Tesla had a strong interest in the pyramids of Giza. He studied the pyramids with the intention to unravel/discover its mystery. His thoughts and theories should be taken into consideration, considering the fact he was an extremely talented man, to put it lightly. This is where science and nature might meet. This is where science goes into the unknown or not so well known areas.

			<br>Was Nikola onto something when he studied the pyramids? Is there any connection, at all, to reincarnation and life? Watch the video and then decide for yourself.
